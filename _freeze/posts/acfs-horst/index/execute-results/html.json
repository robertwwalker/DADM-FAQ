This is a supplement to lubridate that handles a number of special cases with native C++ date/time structures instead of R's date classes.  There are many date and time edge cases and `clock` allows them to be handled in a systematic and consistent way.  There are some useful vignettes for illustration.\n\n- [Getting Started](https://clock.r-lib.org/articles/clock.html)\n- [Motivations for clock](https://clock.r-lib.org/articles/motivations.html)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://clock.r-lib.org/articles/faq.html)\n\n[The full function reference](https://clock.r-lib.org/reference/index.html)\n\n[Here is the package website](https://github.com/r-lib/clock).\n",
