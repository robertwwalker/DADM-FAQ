# the `clock` package

The main page for the just-released clock package by Davis Vaughan is linked.  This is a supplement to lubridate that handles a number of special cases with native C++ date/time structures instead of R's date classes.  There are many date and time edge cases and `clock` allows them to be handled in a systematic and consistent way.  There are some useful vignettes for illustration.
