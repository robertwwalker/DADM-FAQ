One can globally set the theme in an RMarkdown or Quarto Markdown document with `theme_set()`.  If run at the console, every subsequent `ggplot` invocation will default to that theme.  If set inside an R/Qmd file, then it will apply to everything in the file.  First, let me load ggplot.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## The `cars` data

I will use R's internal cars dataset to illustrate.  

`?cars` will detail the variables.

![cars description](img/cars.png)

This is the data. 

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(cars)
```

## A plot with defaults

```{r}
ggplot(cars) + aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point()
```

## Setting a default theme

Let me set the theme for this to `theme_minimal`.

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## The Same Plot with a New Default Theme

```{r}
ggplot(cars) + aes(x=speed, y=dist) + geom_point()
```

## Implications

This is the primary way that one might **brand** the use of ggplot in documents.  There is a common mantra that says, if you write the same code more than twice, it is probably best redone as a function.  I have done this in a gist.

To be continued...
