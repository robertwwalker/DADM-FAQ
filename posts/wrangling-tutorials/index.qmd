[An excellent collection of data wrangling tutorials](https://suzan.rbind.io/categories/tutorial/)

If you have not already, at the R Console, install `learnr`

```
install.packages("learnr")
```

This should make a **Tutorial** pane available in the RStudio.  You can start the tutorials from within RStudio.

There's a nice web collection of tutorials on the rstudio `learnr` site on github: [Examples](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/articles/examples.html)
