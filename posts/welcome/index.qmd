# Setting Up

![](thumbnail.jpg)

To hit the ground running, you will probably need two key bits of software: `R` and `RStudio`.  To wit,

- If you prefer something like VSCode or another IDE, that is your choice.  I will heavily utilize `RMarkdown` and `quarto` and both are extensively supported in RStudio.  The most recent version of [RStudio can be obtained here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

- $R$ can be obtained from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network -- CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for just about all non-mobile OS's.  If you work on a Mac, do make sure that you acquire the one for the specific Mac that you have, e.g. Intel Mac or Apple Silicon [ARM64]
